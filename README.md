# SuffrageNet
Computational Integrity Information Architecture for Electronic Voting using Zero Knowledge Proof Frameworks.

# Components
- Minimal Anti Collusion Infrastructure (MACI)
- Semaphone Signalling Infrastructure (SSI)
- Circom Gadget for Zero Knowledge Proofs

## Inspiration

Concept of Quadratic Voting and how it can help to address the voice of minorities.
Following privacy preserving computational integrity information architectures are also inspirations.

Minimal Anti Collusion Infrastructure from Applied ZKP
Semaphore Signaling Framework from Applied ZKP

## What it does

Generates a prover - verifier infrastructure for constructing the proofs of minority votes.
Generated privacy preserving vote infrastructure using Zero Knowledge Proofs
Ability to execute Quadratic Voting Algorithms to make sure minority voices are addressed

## How I built it

Circom Circuit Compiler generated computational integrity proofs
Proofs are generated in Web Assembly. Proofs are translated to Solidity Smart Contracts. 

## Challenges I ran into
Compilation of Semaphore Smart Contracts.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Integration of Semaphore Framework into Electronic Voting
Identification of Quadratic Voting Concept for Minority Voting

## What I learned

Power of Zero Knowledge Proofs
Power of Semaphore Signaling Framework
Power of Quadratic Voting Concept

## What's next for SaffrageNet

Deployment into Matic Network
Development of a Wallet
Development of a Dashboard
